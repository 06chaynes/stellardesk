# Stellar Desk

[**Stellar Desk**](http://stellardesk.org) is a tool to interact with the Stellar network with a simple interface.
You can use it as an [account viewer](http://stellardesk.org/accounts.html), [wallet](http://stellardesk.org/wallet.html), [network explorer](http://stellardesk.org/ledgers.html), or [markets monitor](http://stellardesk.org/markets.html).
All data is visualized in real time.
